# Stupid Simple QRCode.js
A simplified presentation of [davidshimjs' QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs), this project gives you one thing: A resolution independent QR code generated from the URL hash.

I built it to provide an easy way for me to get URLs to my phone.

## Usage
1. Edit [`index.svg`](index.svg) or [`index.html`](index.html) and change the default URL from `http://mimming.com` to something that makes sense for you.
2. Copy it into a web directory
3. Pass in the text or URL you'd like to QR-ize as a hash fragment a la [http://mimming.com/qr#http://example.com](http://mimming.com/qr#http://example.com).
